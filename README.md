Creating a workout app to track gym progress

Main goals are to essentially be a personal trainer in your pocket. 
The app will
  - Allow users to set workout splits for the week
  - Display either images or gifs of which workout to do, so that it's easier to find which machine to use without searching through the whole gym
  - Track weight lifted, allowing users to remember how much they lifted on each exercise last
  - Track weight lifted increase over time so that users have a tracker to see how much they've improved over time without needing to take size measurements

I wanted to make this app because I like working out, but I often times forget which exercises I really liked the week before.
It's fun to see how much better you are getting at something too, but measuring your weight or width isn't an actual healthy way to track progress, so I prefer this.

I also just want to get better at coding some things, so this is good practice.
